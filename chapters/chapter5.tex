\section{Research Summary}

This research presents an efficient real-time infrared natural gas leak classification method that significantly improves computational efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. The study addressed the critical challenge of detecting methane leaks using infrared cameras while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications in industrial environments.

The primary focus was on optimizing the preprocessing pipeline of VideoGasNet by implementing three different background subtraction methods: Moving Average, Running Average, and Custom Gaussian Mixture Model (CGMM). Additionally, the impact of image resolution reduction on both classification performance and computational efficiency was systematically evaluated.

\section{Key Findings and Contributions}

\subsection{Enhanced Background Subtraction Performance}

The Running Average background subtraction method demonstrated superior performance across all evaluation metrics:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Highest Classification Accuracy:} Achieved 99.71\% classification accuracy, outperforming both Moving Average (99.58\%) and Custom GMM (99.65\%) methods.

\item \textbf{Perfect Leak Detection Precision:} Achieved 100\% precision for leak detection with zero false positives, a critical advancement for practical industrial applications where false alarms can lead to unnecessary inspections and operational costs.

\item \textbf{Superior Processing Speed:} Reduced processing time to 35.88 ms per frame approximately 3× faster than conventional Moving Average approaches (107.39 ms) and 13\% faster than Custom GMM (41.26 ms).

\item \textbf{Excellent Pairwise Performance:} Demonstrated perfect 100\% accuracy for medium to large leak classifications (0-2 through 0-6 pairs) and 98.9\% accuracy for the most challenging small leak scenario (0-1 pair).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Computational Efficiency Optimization}

The study successfully demonstrated that significant computational improvements can be achieved without compromising detection accuracy:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Memory Efficiency:} The Running Average method requires only the current frame and previous background model, eliminating the need to store and process 210 frames as in the original VideoGasNet approach.

\item \textbf{Real-time Processing Capability:} The 3× improvement in processing speed enables deployment in real-time monitoring applications where rapid response to leaks is critical.

\item \textbf{Algorithmic Simplicity:} The exponential weighting approach of the Running Average method provides computational simplicity while maintaining adaptive response to environmental changes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Image Resolution Impact Analysis}

The systematic evaluation of different image resolutions provided valuable insights for practical deployment:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Optimal Resolution Trade-off:} Half-resolution (120×160) images maintain robust accuracy (99.27\%) while decreasing model size by 40\%, offering a compelling balance between performance and efficiency.

\item \textbf{Leak Size Dependency:} Resolution reduction primarily impacts detection of small leaks, with accuracy dropping from 98.9\% at full resolution to 97.1\% at half resolution for the challenging 0-1 pair classification.

\item \textbf{Robust Large Leak Detection:} Detection of medium to large leaks remains remarkably stable across all resolutions, with accuracy consistently above 99.5\% even at quarter resolution (60×80).

\item \textbf{Model Size Reduction:} Quarter-resolution models require 55\% fewer parameters compared to full-resolution models, enabling deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.
\end{enumerate}
